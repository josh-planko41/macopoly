## Setting Up the Game

Welcome the Macopoly! This game is based off of the hit board game Monopoly, with a Macalester twist! To start, press the "Play!" button on the intro screen. This will bring you to the player select screen. Once on the player select screen, Player 1 will select their pawn of choice. Player 2 will follow suit, but be carfeul, don't pick the same pawn! Once both players select their pawns, press "Start" to begin the game. Each player starts with 1500 FP. 

## Object

The object of the game is to become the wealthiest player through buying, renting and trading property   

## Playing the Game 

Player 1 goes first. Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll your dice. Your pawn will move according to the amount rolled. Press the "Finish Turn" button when ready to complete the end of your turn and to pass the dice to the next player. According to the space which their pawn reaches, a player may be entitled to buy properties, -or be obliged to pay rent, pay fees, draw a Chance card, "Go to Duprison", etc. 

If a player rolls doubles, they move their pawn as usual and is subject to any privileges or penalties pertaining to the space on which they land. Retaining the turn, they throw again and move their pawn as before. If a player throws doubles three times in a row, their pawn immediately moves to the space marked "Duprison"

## Starting a New Semester

Each time a player's pawn lands on or passes over "Start a New Semester", whether by roll of the dice or by drawing a card, they are awarded 200 FP

However, 200 FP is paid only once each time around the board. If a player, passing "Start of a New Semester" on the roll of the dice, lands 7 spaces beyond it on "Chance", and draws the card "Advance to Start a New Semester", they collect 200 FP for passing "Start a New Semester" the first time and another 200 FP for reaching it the second time by instructions on the card.

## Buying Property

Whenever a player lands on an unowned property they may buy that property from the Bank at its printed price or decide not to buy it. They receive the Title Deed for the property and ownership is shown both on the dashboard to the right of the game board as well as below the game board when the mouse hovers over that property. 

## Paying Rent

When a player lands on property owned by another player, the owner collects rent from them in accordance with the amount printed on the property's space.

## Free Parking

A player landing on this space does not receive any money, property or reward of any kind. This is just a "free"
resting place.

## Floors

Once a player owns all properties of a certain color, they become eligible to build more Floors on their properties and can do so by selecting the "Build Floors" button beneath the dice. 

Floors must be constructed evenly. The first purchased Floor may be applied to any unimproved property, but the next one must also be constructed on an unimproved property of this or any other complete color-set that player owns. 

The price of construction and consequential rent increase is shown in the "Build Floors" pop-up window and the property's space respectively.

## Selling Property 

Properties in Macopoly may be sold ONLY when a player is facing bankruptcy due to rent by selecting the appropriate choice in the pop-up window when prompted

## Duprison (WIP)

A player lands in Duprison when. . . (1.) their pawn lands on the space marked "Go to Duprison"; (2.) they draw a card marked "Go to Duprison"; (3.) they roll doubles three times in succession. When a player is sent to Duprison they cannot collect 200 FP salary in that move since, regardless of where their pawn is on the board, it goes directly to Duprison. A player's turn ends when they are sent to Duprison. If a player is not "sent to Duprison" but in the ordinary course of play lands on that space, they are "Just Visiting", incur no penalty, and move ahead in the usual manner on his next turn.

A player gets out of Jail by... (1.) rolling doubles on any of their next three turns. If they succeed in doing this they immediately move forward the number of spaces shown by their doubles roll. Even though they rolled doubles they do not take another turn; (2.) using the "Get Out of Duprison" card if they have it. If the player does not roll doubles by their third turn they must pay the 50 FP fine. They then get out of Duprison and immediately move forward the number of spaces shown by their ro;;.

## MacBooks and Activity Fee

Players that land on these spaces must pay the corresponding amount of FP. 

## Chance

When a player lands on these spaces a card will automatically be shown and the player will automatically follow instructions displayed on the screen. 

## Bankruptcy and Ending the Game

The game ends when one of the players runs out of FP and cannot sell any properties equaling or exceeding the value of the amount that player owes.
