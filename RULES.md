## Setting Up the Game

Welcome the Macopoly! This game is based off of the hit board game Monopoly, with a Macalester twist! To start, press the "Play!" button on the intro screen. This will bring you to the player select screen. Once on the player select screen, Player 1 will select their pawn of choice. Player 2 will follow suit, but be carfeul, don't pick the same pawn! Once both players select their pawns, press "Start" to begin the game. 

## Starting the Game 

Player 1 goes first. Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll your dice. Your pawn will move accordingly to the amount rolled.
